# HEDS-workshop
R and RStudio workshop for the higher education data sharing consortium
Sunday, June 18, beginning at 1:30 p.m 

# Workshop Information

R is quickly becoming the default programming language of data science. Not only is R used at leading tech companies like Facebook and Google, but it is also used throughout academia and is now taught at the undergraduate level at many colleges and universities. A typical argument against using R is that it has a steep learning curve. Good news! Thanks to the work of RStudio this is no longer true.

This workshop will use IPEDS data to introduce participants to using R and RStudio to create more efficient workflows. We will use this data to introduce a new approach to R programming that streamlines the coding process and often accelerates analyses. Every participant will leave the workshop with a reproducible html report with a map, table, and graph. Never worked with html or javascript? No worries, RStudio will take care of that for us. All participants will need access to a computer with R and RStudio. A TeX installation is not required for the workshop, but will be useful if you continue to use R and RStudio. All software should be installed and tested prior to the workshop. Prior to the workshop please confirm that you have administrative privileges on the computer you will be using so we can install R packages during the workshop.

Our entire analysis process will be conducted in RStudio (data import, manipulation, analysis, visualization, etc.). We will even combine our narrative text with R code to create a completely reproducible analysis. Applying a reproducible research methodology to our work can make us more efficient and reduce our risk of injecting error into the analysis.

# Instructor 

Rich Majerus is the Director of Advancement Strategy and Analysis at Colby College. At Colby, he oversees the Prospect Research team and develops new approaches to modeling and visualizing fundraising data. He regularly teaches R workshops and is listed in RStudio’s directory of instructors. Prior to his work at Colby, Rich was a founder of Third Coast Analytics, a successful and profitable data science consulting firm (Third Coast’s IP was acquired by Capture Higher Ed in 2016). Rich has also worked as a quantitative technologist at Reed College, and as an Assistant Dean of Admissions at Carleton College. He holds an M.A. in sociology from the University of Notre Dame, where he studied in the Center for Research on Educational Opportunity and a B.A. in sociology and anthropology from Carleton College (Summa Cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa).
